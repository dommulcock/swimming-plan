    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Waters -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as an interactive weekly planner rather than a linear document. The core design consists of a main dashboard with controls to filter by month and week. This approach was chosen to provide immediate, task-oriented access to any specific workout, which is the primary user goal ("What is my workout today?"). A line chart provides an at-a-glance visualization of the program's progression, offering motivation and context. Key reference information (Concepts, Equipment) is offloaded into modals to keep the main interface clean and focused on the workout details. This structure enhances usability by prioritizing quick navigation and reducing information overload compared to the original long-form text document. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Program Progression: Report's increasing weekly volume -> Goal: Show change -> Viz: Line Chart (Chart.js) -> Interaction: Highlights current week -> Justification: Best method to visualize trends over time.
        - Workout Structure (Month/Week/Session): Report's hierarchical structure -> Goal: Organize & Navigate -> Viz: HTML/CSS Tabs & Cards -> Interaction: Click filters content -> Justification: Intuitive UI for drill-down.
        - Workout Details: Report's session text -> Goal: Inform -> Viz: Styled HTML lists within expandable cards -> Interaction: Click to expand/collapse -> Justification: Presents instructions clearly without clutter.
        - Reference Info (Concepts/Equipment): Report's introductory text -> Goal: Reference -> Viz: HTML/CSS Modals -> Interaction: Button click to open -> Justification: Provides on-demand info without distracting from the main view.
